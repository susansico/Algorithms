# Algorithms
These algorithms were written to prepare for interviews for web developer positions.  Algorithms.html is a web page with fields in a form to test each algorithm and also to show the results.  The algorithms are written in JavaScript. Each algorithm JavaScript file has a self-identifying name. Algorithms.js includes utility functions written for the algorithms.

The algorithms are Anagrams, Decimal to Hexadecimal, Decimal to Reverse Binary Bitwise, Decimal to Reverse Decimal, Factorial, Fibonacci Numbers, Hexadecimal to Decimal, Insertion Sort, Median.js, Missing Numbers, Palindromes, Prime, and QuickSort.

TBD are a field check for correct input and a solution for Chrome issue where assigning an algorithm result to a field triggers navigation to the form action attribute.
